# Text and color in CSS

## Color
Colors are used in many CSS properties. There are five main ways to reference a color in CSS:

1. RGB value: This color model adds the colors red (R), green (G), and blue (B) together to create colors. Each value is defined as a number between 0 and 255, representing the intensity of that color. For example, the color red would have the RGB value of 255,0,0.

2. RGBA value: This is an extension of RGB that adds an alpha (A) channel to represent opacity or transparency of the color.

3. HSL value: HSL is a newer color model defined as Hue (H), Saturation (S), and Lightness (L). Hue represents the degree value on a circle, saturation represents the distance from the center of the circle to its edge, and lightness represents the distance from the bottom to the top of a 3D cylinder.

4. Hex value: Colors can be specified using a hexadecimal value. Hexadecimal uses 16 digits (0-9 and A-F) to represent colors. For example, the color red would be written as #FF0000.

5. Predefined color names: Modern web browsers support 140 predefined color names, such as black, silver, red, green, etc.

## Text
CSS provides several properties to manipulate text:

1. Text color: The `color` property sets the color of text.

2. Text font and size: The `font-family` property sets the font used by text, and the `font-size` property sets the size of the font.

3. Text transformation: The `text-transform` property is used to change the capitalization of text.

4. Text decoration: The `text-decoration` property is used to apply additional decoration to text, such as underlining or strikethrough.

These are the most common ways to work with text and color in CSS.
