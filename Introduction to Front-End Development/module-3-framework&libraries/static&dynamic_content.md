## Topics Covered in the Video

### 1. Difference between Static and Dynamic Content
- Static content: Files transferred as they are stored on the web server (e.g., images, videos).
- Dynamic content: Generated when an HTTP request is made, based on user input or other factors (e.g., personalized recommendations on shopping websites).

### 2. Web Servers and Application Servers
- Web server: Sends website content to the browser.
- Application server (or back-end): Generates dynamic content requested by the web server.

### 3. Examples of Static and Dynamic Content
- Static content example: Watching a video - the web server sends the file to the browser.
- Dynamic content example: Logging into a course - the web server communicates with the application server to confirm enrollment and show personalized content.

### 4. Role of Application Servers
- Application servers perform complex processing, such as running application logic, communicating with databases, and checking permissions.

### 5. Caching for Performance Improvement
- Web servers use caching to store a copy of dynamic content.
- Caching reduces the need for the application server to generate content for every request.
- On subsequent requests, the web server can immediately send the cached content, improving performance.

### 6. Benefits of Caching
- Caching reduces the load on application servers, as they don't need to generate content for every request.
- It improves response times for users by serving content from the cache instead of generating it dynamically.
