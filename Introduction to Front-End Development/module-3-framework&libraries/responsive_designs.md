# Introduction to Responsive Design

## Key Details:
- Responsive design allows a web page to automatically adjust its size and layout based on the device it is viewed on.
- It consists of three techniques: flexible grids, fluid images, and media queries.
- Flexible grids use percentage values to adjust the size of website elements based on screen size.
- Fluid images scale down to fit in a flexibly sized column without becoming pixelated.
- Media queries allow developers to apply CSS rules based on screen size, orientation, and aspect ratio.

## Responsive Design and Screen Resolution:
- Screens are made up of pixels, and screen resolution refers to the number of pixels a screen contains.
- Responsive design is important because there are many different screens with different resolutions.
- High-resolution screens group multiple physical pixels into one logical pixel to display smoother images and text.

## Techniques of Responsive Design:
1. Flexible Grids:
   - Made up of columns, gutters, and margins.
   - Defined in percentage values to adjust depending on screen size.

2. Fluid Images:
   - Set the CSS max-width property of images to 100%.
   - Images scale down to fit in a flexibly sized column without becoming pixelated.

3. Media Queries:
   - Part of CSS that allows developers to query display size, orientation, and aspect ratio.
   - Conditionally apply CSS rules based on screen size.

## Breakpoints and Grid Types:
- Breakpoints are the points at which a website's content and layout adapt to provide the best user experience.
- There are three types of grids:
  1. Fixed Grid: Fixed width columns with flexible margins.
  2. Fluid Grid: Fluid width columns with fixed gutters and side margins.
  3. Hybrid Grid: Combination of fluid width and fixed width components.

## Conclusion:
- Responsive design is a combination of flexible grids, fluid images, and media queries.
- It allows websites to automatically adjust their layout based on the device, delivering a responsive grid.
- Bootstrap is a popular framework for building responsive mobile-first sites.
