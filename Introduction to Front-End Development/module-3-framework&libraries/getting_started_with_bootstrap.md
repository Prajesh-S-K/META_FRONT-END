# Getting started with bootstrap:

The topic covered in this video is about creating a simple Bootstrap webpage. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to create the webpage:

1. Setting up the layout:
   - Add a container element using the HTML div element and apply the container CSS class provided by Bootstrap.
   - Add a row element using the HTML div element and apply the row CSS class provided by Bootstrap.

2. Adding columns:
   - Add two column elements using the HTML div element and apply the col CSS class provided by Bootstrap.
   - Name the columns by adding heading tags (H1 or H2) inside each column div.

3. Adding content to the columns:
   - Under the first column div, add a heading 2 tag and the name of the dish.
   - Add a paragraph tag to list the ingredients of the dish.
   - Add an image tag with the source attribute set to the name of the image file.
   - Apply the CSS class "IMG-fluid" to ensure the image scales to its parent column's width.
   - Repeat the above steps for each dish, adding a new heading 2 tag, paragraph tag, and image tag.

4. Adding a price table:
   - Under the second column div, add an HTML table tag and apply the Bootstrap CSS class "table".
   - Add two table row tags (tr) to create a row for each dish.
   - Add table data tags (td) inside each table row to define the contents of table cells.
   - Add the dish name and price inside the table data tags.

5. Saving and previewing the webpage:
   - Save the file by pressing the keys Control and S (or Command and S on Mac).
   - Preview the webpage in live preview to see the layout, columns, images, and price table.
