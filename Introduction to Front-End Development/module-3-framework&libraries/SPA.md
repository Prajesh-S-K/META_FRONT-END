# Single Page Applications

## Summary

- Single-page applications (SPAs) provide a user-friendly and mobile-friendly experience.
- SPAs have only one HTML page that gets sent from the server to the browser.
- The page updates its content as users interact with the website, providing a faster and more responsive browsing experience.
- SPAs can serve code and resources through bundling or lazy loading.
- Bundling loads all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript immediately.
- Lazy loading loads only the minimum resources needed and downloads additional resources as required.
- The choice between bundling and lazy loading depends on the size, complexity, and bandwidth requirements of the application.
- SPAs are more efficient when updating specific parts of a page compared to traditional websites.
- Traditional websites generate and send entire web pages for every request, consuming excessive bandwidth and CPU time.
- SPAs send JSON objects containing only the data to be displayed, resulting in smaller requests and faster updates.
- Consider the complexity of your website when deciding between a traditional multi-page application and an SPA.
