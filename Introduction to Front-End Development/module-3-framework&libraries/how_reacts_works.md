# Summary:
- React components can be used to develop user interfaces.
- React uses a virtual DOM to update the browser DOM efficiently.
- The virtual DOM is a representation of the browser DOM kept in memory.
- React compares the virtual DOM to the previous version to determine changes.
- Only the changed elements are updated in the browser DOM.
- This process is called reconciliation.

# Keynotes:
- React components have a one-to-one relationship with HTML elements on the webpage.
- React's virtual DOM is used to track which HTML elements need to be updated.
- The virtual DOM is updated first, then compared to the previous version.
- Only the changed elements are updated in the browser DOM.
- Updating the entire DOM is time-intensive, so React's approach is more efficient.
