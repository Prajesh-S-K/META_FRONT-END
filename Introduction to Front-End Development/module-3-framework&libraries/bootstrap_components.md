# Bootstrap Components :
The video introduces Bootstrap components, which are pre-made UI elements and styles that can be used to enhance a website's design and functionality. These components range from alert messages to navigation menus and are designed to be visually appealing and responsive.

In the video, the example of a restaurant website called Little Lemon is used to demonstrate the use of Bootstrap components. The goal is to update the website and add a new dish, Fried Calamari, to the menu.

Here's how Bootstrap components are used in the video:

1. Adding the new dish:
   - A new `<h2>` tag is added in the menu column with the name of the dish, "Fried Calamari".
   - The ingredients are listed inside a paragraph tag.
   - An image of the dish is added using an `<img>` tag with the source attribute set to "calamari.jpeg". The image is given the class "img-fluid" to ensure it scales properly.

2. Highlighting the new dish:
   - A badge component is used to highlight that the dish is new.
   - A `<span>` element is added next to "Fried Calamari" with the class "badge".
   - The background color of the badge is set using the class "bg-primary", which displays it in Bootstrap's primary color (blue).
   - The text "new" is added inside the span.

3. Improving visuals with card components:
   - Card elements are used to style and organize the content for each dish.
   - A row is added below the "Our Menu" heading.
   - A `<div>` element is added for each dish, with classes for mobile and desktop devices.
   - Inside each div, a card element is added using the class "card".
   - The image tag for each dish is moved inside the card and given the class "card-img-top".
   - The header and paragraph elements for each dish are moved inside a `<div>` with the class "card-body".
   - The header is given the class "card-title" and the paragraph is given the class "card-text".

4. Updating prices:
   - A table row is added for the new dish under the price column.
   - Two `<td>` tags are added, one for the dish name and one for the price.

The video concludes by mentioning that there are many more Bootstrap components available to further improve the website's layout and design.

By using Bootstrap components, you can easily create a visually appealing and responsive website. Happy coding!
