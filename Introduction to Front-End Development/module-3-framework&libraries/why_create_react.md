## Introduction to React

React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components which present data that changes over time. React doesnâ€™t use templates like traditional web application UIs. Instead, it breaks user interfaces into components, using JavaScript as a programming language to render views.

React updates are efficient. When your data changes, the render method is called again. React compares the return value from the previous call to render with the new one and generates a minimal set of changes to be applied to the DOM. This process is called reconciliation.

React offers flexibility and additional features. It has its own lightweight representation of the document, allowing for dynamic charts, single-page web apps, and even running React on the server for SEO and performance benefits.
