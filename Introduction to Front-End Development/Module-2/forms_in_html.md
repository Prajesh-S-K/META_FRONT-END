# Introduction to HTML Forms

- HTML forms are essential for various functionalities on the internet, such as online shopping and user login.
- Forms submit HTTP requests containing data to the server.
- Forms are defined using the `<form>` tags, with an optional `action` attribute specifying the URL or path for the form submission.
- The `method` attribute specifies the HTTP method to use for the request, either GET or POST.
- Input fields are added using the `<input>` tags.
- The `type` attribute of the `<input>` tag determines the type of input field.
- Common input types include:
  - Text input: `<input type="text">`
  - Password input: `<input type="password">`
  - Checkbox input: `<input type="checkbox">`
  - Radio button input: `<input type="radio">`
  - Text area input: `<textarea>`
  - Select dropdown input: `<select>` and `<option>`
- Each input field can have additional attributes like `name` and `value` to configure how the data is sent to the server.
- Different input types have different behaviors and user interactions.
- The user experience of forms can vary, and it's important to choose appropriate input types for better usability.
