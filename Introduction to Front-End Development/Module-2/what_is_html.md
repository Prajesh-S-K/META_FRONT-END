# Introduction to HTML Documents and Tags

- HTML documents are like the frame of a building, providing the basic structure for a web page.
- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
- Hypertext refers to text with links to other text, while Markup refers to tags and elements used within a document.
- HTML files usually have a .html suffix, and the first page of a website is often called index.html.
- HTML elements consist of opening and closing tags enclosed in angle brackets.
- Elements can also be self-closing, meaning they do not have a closing tag.
- HTML elements can contain other elements, allowing for nested structures.
- The HTML specification is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with the current version being HTML 5.

## HTML Tags and Elements

- HTML tags are used to create elements that build the structure of a web page.
- Each HTML element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
- Opening tags are enclosed in angle brackets, while closing tags have a forward slash before the tag name.
- Elements can be empty or self-closing, indicated by a forward slash before the closing angle bracket.
- Examples of HTML tags include `<p>` for paragraphs and `<br>` for line breaks.
- Elements can be nested within each other to create more complex structures.

## HTML Standards

- The HTML specification defines the rules and structure for elements and tags.
- The specification is maintained by the W3C.
- Whenever the specification changes, a new version of HTML is standardized.
- The current version is HTML 5.

## HTML and CSS

- HTML elements form the structure of a web page and describe what to display.
- To control the appearance of a web page, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used.
- CSS will be covered in more detail in this course.
