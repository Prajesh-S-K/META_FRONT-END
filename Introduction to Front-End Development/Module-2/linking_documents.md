# Video: Linking Web Pages Together

- To build a website, you need to link multiple web pages together.
- Hyperlinks, also known as links, are used to link pages together.
- To create a hyperlink, you use the anchor tag `<a>` with the `href` attribute.
- In your project folder, create a new file for the second webpage (e.g., `location.html`).
- In the new file, add the heading and content for the webpage (e.g., address).
- Save the file using the appropriate keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl + S` or `Command + S`).
- Navigate back to the `index.html` file to add a link to the `location.html` file.
- Below the last paragraph tag, add the anchor tag `<a>` with the `href` attribute pointing to the `location.html` file.
- Within the anchor tag, add a descriptive text that will be displayed as the link name on the webpage.
- Save the `index.html` file to update it with the changes.
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to test if the link works.
- The link will be displayed as a clickable text on the webpage.
- Clicking on the link will open the `location.html` file.

Congratulations! You have learned how to link different web pages together to create your own website.
