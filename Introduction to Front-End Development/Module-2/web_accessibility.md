- Screen reader software reads the content of websites and everything happening on the device.
- Speech recognition software turns spoken words into computer commands or dictates inputting text.
- Subtitles and video scripts assist those with audio and visual disabilities.
- Improving accessibility is best done from the beginning of a project.
