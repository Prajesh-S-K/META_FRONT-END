# Workflows in Computer Programming

## What is a Workflow?
A workflow is like a step-by-step guide that helps you complete a task efficiently. 

### Example:
- **Baking a Cake**: 
  - You follow a recipe instead of throwing all ingredients together at once.
  - Steps include mixing flour, sugar, and eggs, baking, and decorating.

## Importance of Workflows in Programming
- Helps developers know what steps to take.
- Ensures everyone on the team is on the same page.
- Keeps the project running smoothly.

## Feature Branching
- A common type of workflow.
- Think of it like having a separate workspace for each cake flavor.
- You create a new branch for a specific feature, make changes, and share it with the main team when ready.
- Keeps the main project stable while you experiment.
