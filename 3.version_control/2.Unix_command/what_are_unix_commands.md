# Unix Commands

## Definition
- Unix commands are instructions used in the Unix operating system and its derivatives (like Linux) to perform specific tasks.

## Key Features
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Unix commands are executed in a text-based interface, allowing for powerful and flexible control over the system.
- **Syntax**: Typically follows the format: `command [options] [arguments]`.

## Common Commands
- `ls`: Lists the contents of a directory.
  - Example: `ls -l` (detailed list), `ls -a` (includes hidden files).
- `cd`: Changes the current directory.
  - Example: `cd /path/to/directory`.
- `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
- `cp`: Copies files or directories.
  - Example: `cp source.txt destination.txt`.
- `mv`: Moves or renames files or directories.
  - Example: `mv oldname.txt newname.txt`.
- `rm`: Removes files or directories.
  - Example: `rm file.txt`.

## Help and Documentation
- **Manual Pages**: Use the `man` command to access the manual for any command.
  - Example: `man ls` provides detailed information about the `ls` command.

## Flags
- Flags modify the behavior of commands.
  - Example: `ls -l` (long format) vs. `ls -a` (show all files).

## Conclusion
- Mastering Unix commands is essential for effective software development and system management.
