# What is Version Control?

- **Version Control** is like a time machine for your files, especially for developers working on code.
- It keeps track of all changes made to files, so you can see what was changed, when, and by whom.
- If something goes wrong, you can go back to an earlier version of your work.
- It helps teams work together by allowing them to share and manage changes to the same project without confusion.
- Just like how word processors save different versions of a document, version control does the same for code.
- It also helps in reviewing each other's work, making sure everything is correct before finalizing changes.

In short, version control is a tool that helps you manage changes to your work efficiently and safely!
