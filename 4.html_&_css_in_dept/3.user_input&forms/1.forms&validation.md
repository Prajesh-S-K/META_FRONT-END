# Form Validation in Web Development

## Introduction
This material focuses on the importance of form validation in web development, ensuring that user input is accurate and usable.

## Understanding Form Validation
- **Form validation** is essential to ensure that the data entered by users is valid and meets the rules set by the developer. This prevents issues like incorrect delivery addresses in an online food delivery service.
- There are two main types of validation:
  - **Client-side validation**: Provides immediate feedback as users fill out the form.
  - **Server-side validation**: Checks the data after submission for security and integrity.

## Client-side vs. Server-side Validation
- **Client-side validation** uses the web browser or JavaScript to check for errors in real-time, alerting users to any mistakes before submission.
- **Server-side validation** occurs after the form is submitted, allowing for more complex checks, such as verifying data against a database, ensuring that malicious users cannot submit invalid data.

## HTML Input Types and Validation
- HTML provides various input types (e.g., `email`, `tel`, `url`) that automatically validate user input, helping to ensure that the data entered is in the correct format.
- The `required` attribute can be used to indicate mandatory fields, prompting users to fill them out before submission.

**Remember**: Mastering these concepts will enhance your web development skills and improve user experience on websites. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you need further clarification! You've got this!
