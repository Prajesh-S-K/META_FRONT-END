## Form Actions and Methods

### Form Actions
- The **action** attribute specifies the URL where the form data should be sent when the form is submitted.
- It can be:
  - A **full URL** (e.g., `https://example.com/submit`)
  - An **absolute path** (e.g., `/submit`), which combines with the base URL of the current site.
  - A **relative path** (e.g., `submit`), which combines with the current page's URL.

### Form Methods
- The **method** attribute defines how the data will be sent to the server. The two most common methods are:
  - **GET**: 
    - Appends form data to the URL, visible in the browser's address bar.
    - Suitable for non-sensitive data and when bookmarking is needed.
  - **POST**: 
    - Sends form data in the body of the HTTP request, not visible in the URL.
    - Used for sensitive data (like passwords) or when submitting large amounts of data.

### Example
```html
<form action="/submit" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="username">
  <input type="password" name="password">
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```
In this example:

The form data will be sent to the `/submit` URL using the POST method.
