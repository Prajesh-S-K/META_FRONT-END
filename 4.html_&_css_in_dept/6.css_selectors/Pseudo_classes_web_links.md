# Understanding Pseudo-Classes in CSS: A Simple Explanation

In web development, **pseudo-classes** are special tools that help us style elements on a webpage based on their state. For example, when you visit a link, it can change color to show that you've already clicked on it. This is done using pseudo-classes like:

- **Link**: The default state of a link.
- **Visited**: For links you've clicked.
- **Hover**: When you move your mouse over a link.
- **Active**: When you are clicking on it.

Think of it like a traffic light for links:

- **Green (Hover)**: You can go ahead and click.
- **Red (Visited)**: It means you've already been there.

The order in which you apply these styles matters, just like following traffic rules. Remember the acronym **LVHA**:

- **L**ink
- **V**isited
- **H**over
- **A**ctive

This will help you keep your styles organized and prevent any confusion!
