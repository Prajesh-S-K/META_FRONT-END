In this lesson, the following types of CSS selectors were mentioned:

1. **Element (Type) Selectors**: Selects elements based on their type (e.g., `div`, `p`, `h1`).
2. **ID Selectors**: Selects an element based on its unique ID (e.g., `#myId`).
3. **Class Selectors**: Selects elements based on their class attribute (e.g., `.myClass`).
4. **Attribute Selectors**: Selects elements based on the presence or value of an attribute (e.g., `[type="text"]`).
5. **Nth-of-type Selectors**: Selects the nth child of a specific type within a parent (e.g., `li:nth-of-type(2)`).
6. **Nth-child Selectors**: Selects the nth child of any type within a parent (e.g., `li:nth-child(2)`).
7. **Star Selectors**: Selects all elements on the page (e.g., `*`).
8. **Group Selectors**: Allows you to apply the same styles to multiple elements (e.g., `h1, p`).
