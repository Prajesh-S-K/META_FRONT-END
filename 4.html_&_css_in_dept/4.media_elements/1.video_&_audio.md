When you want to include a video or audio on your website, you use special tags in HTML called the video tag and the audio tag. Think of these tags as containers that hold your media, just like a box holds your toys. 

For videos, you can use file types like MP4, WebM, or OGG, while for audio, you can use MP3, WAV, or OGG. This is similar to how you might choose different formats for your favorite songs or movies.

Here's a simple example of how to use the video tag:

The video tag is like saying, "Hey, I want to show a video!"
The source element inside it tells the browser where to find the video file (in this case, "dance.mp4") and what type it is.
The controls attribute adds buttons for play, pause, and volume, making it user-friendly.
If the browser can't play the video format, it will show a message instead.
Code Examples
```html
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="dance.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
