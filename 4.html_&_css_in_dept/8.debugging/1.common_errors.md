# Common Errors in Programming: A Simple Explanation

In programming, making mistakes is completely normal! Just like when you're learning to ride a bike, you might wobble or fall a few times before you get it right. In coding, there are three main types of errors:

1. **Skill-based Errors**: 
   - Often simple typos, like forgetting to close a bracket or misspelling a word.
   - These are easy to fix but can take a lot of time to find.

2. **Rule-based Errors**: 
   - Happen when you donâ€™t follow specific coding rules, like starting a class name with a number.

3. **Knowledge-based Errors**: 
   - Occur when you know how to code but might forget certain details, leading to confusion.

## Best Practices to Avoid Errors

To avoid these errors, you can follow some best practices:

- **Use Shorthand**: 
  - Makes your code cleaner and easier to read. Think of it like using abbreviations in texting; it saves time and space!

- **Understand Specificity**: 
  - Helps you know which rules apply to your code. Just like in a game where certain rules apply to specific players, in coding, some rules are more important than others.

By practicing and applying these good habits, you'll become a better coder and make fewer mistakes over time!
