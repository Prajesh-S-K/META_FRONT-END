# Understanding Developer Tools in Web Browsers

In the video, we learned about **developer tools** in web browsers, which are like a toolbox for web developers. Just as an electrician uses tools to fix electrical problems, developers use these tools to find and fix issues on their web pages. 

When a webpage doesn't look right, these tools help you inspect the code behind it, allowing you to see what might be going wrong.

## Analogy
Imagine you're trying to find a missing puzzle piece. The developer tools let you look closely at each piece of the puzzle (the HTML and CSS code) to see how they fit together. 

- You can right-click on any part of the webpage and select **"Inspect"** to see the code that creates that part. 
- This makes it easier to spot mistakes and fix them quickly, just like finding that elusive puzzle piece!
