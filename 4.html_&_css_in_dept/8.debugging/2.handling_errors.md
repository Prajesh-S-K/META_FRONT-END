# Handling Errors in CSS: A Simple Explanation

In CSS, when you make a mistake, like forgetting a semicolon, the code doesn't stop working entirely. Instead, it just skips over the parts it doesn't understand and continues to apply the rest of the styles. 

**Analogy:** 
- Imagine you're baking a cake, and you accidentally forget to add sugar. The cake might not taste as sweet, but it will still bake! 
- Similarly, in CSS, the styles before the error still work, but anything after the mistake might not show up as intended.

## Using Linters

To help catch these mistakes, developers use tools called **linters**. 

**Think of a linter as a helpful friend who checks your homework for errors.** 
- It looks for specific rules and best practices in your code, pointing out things that might not be right. 
- For example, if you wrote `opacity: 50%;` instead of `opacity: 0.5%;`, the linter would let you know.

By using these tools, you can improve your CSS and make sure everything looks just right!
