# Flexbox Properties

1. **justify-content**: 
   - Aligns flex items along the **main axis** (horizontal by default).
   - Common values include:
     - `flex-start`: Items are packed toward the start of the flex container.
     - `flex-end`: Items are packed toward the end.
     - `center`: Items are centered.
     - `space-between`: Items are evenly distributed with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
     - `space-around`: Items are evenly distributed with space around them.

2. **align-items**: 
   - Aligns flex items along the **cross axis** (vertical by default).
   - Common values include:
     - `flex-start`: Items are aligned at the start of the cross axis.
     - `flex-end`: Items are aligned at the end.
     - `center`: Items are centered along the cross axis.
     - `baseline`: Items are aligned along their baseline.
     - `stretch`: Items stretch to fill the container.

3. **align-self**: 
   - Allows the alignment of individual flex items on the **cross axis**, overriding the `align-items` property for that specific item.

4. **align-content**: 
   - Used for multi-line flex containers to control the spacing between lines along the **cross axis**.
   - Common values include:
     - `flex-start`: Lines are packed toward the start.
     - `flex-end`: Lines are packed toward the end.
     - `center`: Lines are centered.
     - `space-between`: Lines are evenly distributed.
     - `space-around`: Lines are evenly distributed with space around them.

5. **flex-wrap**: 
   - Controls whether flex items should wrap onto multiple lines.
   - Values include:
     - `nowrap`: All items will be on one line (default).
     - `wrap`: Items will wrap onto multiple lines.
     - `wrap-reverse`: Items will wrap onto multiple lines in reverse order.

6. **flex-direction**: 
   - Defines the direction of the **main axis**.
   - Values include:
     - `row`: Items are placed in a row (default).
     - `row-reverse`: Items are placed in a row in reverse order.
     - `column`: Items are placed in a column.
     - `column-reverse`: Items are placed in a column in reverse order.

7. **gap**: 
   - Creates space between flex items along the main axis. You can also use `row-gap` and `column-gap` for specific spacing.

8. **flex**: 
   - A shorthand property for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.
   - Controls how a flex item grows or shrinks to fit the space available.
   - Example: `flex: 1 1 auto;` means the item can grow and shrink, with an initial size based on its content.
