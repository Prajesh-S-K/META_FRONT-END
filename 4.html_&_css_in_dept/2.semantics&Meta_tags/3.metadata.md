# 1. Meta Tags and SEO

**Meta tags** are like little notes that you add to the head of your web page's HTML document. They provide important information about your page to search engines, helping them understand what your page is about. 

Think of it like putting a label on a box; it tells anyone looking at the box what's inside without having to open it. 

## Types of Meta Tags

- **Description Tag**: Gives a brief summary of your page's content, often used by search engines to show a snippet in search results.
- **Author Tag**: Tells who created the page.
- **Robots Tag**: Gives instructions to search engine bots on how to treat your page.

By using these tags wisely, you can improve how your website ranks in search results, making it easier for people to find you online!
