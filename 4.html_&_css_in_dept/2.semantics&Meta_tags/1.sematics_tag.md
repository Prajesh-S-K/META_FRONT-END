# 1. Semantics :
we learned about semantic HTML, which is all about using specific HTML tags to give meaning to the content on a web page. Think of it like labeling boxes in a storage room. If you label a box "Books," anyone can easily find what they need without opening every box. Similarly, using semantic tags like `<header>`,` <nav>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` helps search engines and accessibility tools understand the structure and purpose of your content.

For example, if you're writing a blog post about your summer vacation, you would wrap the entire post in an `<article>` tag. This tells browsers and screen readers that this section is a complete piece of content. Inside that, you can use headings and paragraphs to organize your thoughts. Just like a well-organized room makes it easier to find things, using semantic HTML makes your web pages more accessible and easier to navigate!
