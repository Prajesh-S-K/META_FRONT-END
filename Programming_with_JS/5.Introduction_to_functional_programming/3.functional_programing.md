# Understanding Functional Programming and Object-Oriented Programming

## Introduction
In the world of programming, there are different styles or paradigms that developers use to write code. Two popular paradigms are functional programming (FP) and object-oriented programming (OOP). In this book, we will explore the basic concepts, differences, and examples of these two programming paradigms.

## Chapter 1: Functional Programming (FP)
### 1.1 Definition
- Functional programming is a coding style that emphasizes the use of functions and variables.
- In FP, data and functionality are kept separate, and data is passed into functions for computation.

### 1.2 Key Concepts
- Functions: In FP, functions play a central role. They take input data and produce output based on that data.
- Data Separation: FP focuses on keeping data and functionality separate, which helps in writing modular and reusable code.
- Pure Functions: Pure functions are functions that always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects.

### 1.3 Example
Function to calculate the total of two numbers:
```javascript
function getTotal(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
var num1 = 2;
var num2 = 3;
var total = getTotal(num1, num2);
```

## Chapter 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
### 2.1 Definition
- Object-oriented programming is a coding style that groups data and functionality as properties and methods inside objects.
- OOP helps in modeling real-life objects and focuses on the concept of objects and their interactions.

### 2.2 Key Concepts
- Objects: Objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior.
- Properties: Properties represent the state or characteristics of an object.
- Methods: Methods are functions associated with objects that perform specific actions or operations.

### 2.3 Example
Object representing a virtual pet:
```javascript
var virtualPet = {
  sleepy: true,
  nap: function() {
    this.sleepy = false;
  }
}
console.log(virtualPet.sleepy); // true
virtualPet.nap();
console.log(virtualPet.sleepy); // false
```

# end :
Here are some of the most important ones:

First-class functions

Higher-order function

Pure functions and side-effects

There are many other concepts and priciples in functional programming, but for now, let's stick to these three.
