# construtor

Constructor functions, commonly referred to as just "constructors", are special functions that allow us to build instances of these built-in native objects. All the constructors are capitalized.

```js
new Date();

new Error();

new Map();

new Promise();

new Set();

new WeakSet();

new WeakMap();
```

## Example:
```javascript
function Icecream(flavor) {
	this.flavor = flavor;

this.meltIt = function() {

console.log(`The ${this.flavor} icecream has melted`);

}

}

  

let kiwiIcecream = new Icecream("kiwi");

let appleIcecream = new Icecream("apple");

kiwiIcecream; // --> Icecream {flavor: 'kiwi', meltIt: ƒ}

appleIcecream; // --> Icecream {flavor: 'apple', meltIt: ƒ}
```
