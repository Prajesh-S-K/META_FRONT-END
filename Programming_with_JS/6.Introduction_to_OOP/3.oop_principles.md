# OOP Principles
## 1.Inheritance
To setup the inheritance relation between classes in JavaScript, I can use the `extends` keyword, as in class B extends A.

## 2.Encapsulation
In the simplest terms, encapsulation has to do with making a code implementation "hidden" from other users, in the sense that they don't have to know how my code works in order to "consume" the code.

## 3.Abstraction
Abstraction is all about writing code in a way that will make it more generalized.

The concepts of encapsulation and abstraction are often misunderstood because their differences can feel blurry.

It helps to think of it in the following terms:

- An abstraction is about extracting the _concept_ of what you're trying to do, rather than dealing with a specific manifestation of that concept.
    
- Encapsulation is about you not having access to, or not being concerned with, how some implementation works internally.

## 4.Polymorphism
Polymorphism is a word derived from the Greek language meaning "multiple forms". An alternative translation might be: "something that can take on many shapes".

```js
const bicycle = {
	bell: function() {
		return "Ring, ring! Watch out, please!"
	}
}

const door = {
	bell: function() {
		return "Ring, ring! Come here, please!"
	}

}

bicycle.bell(); // "Get away, please"
door.bell(); // "Come here, please"
```
