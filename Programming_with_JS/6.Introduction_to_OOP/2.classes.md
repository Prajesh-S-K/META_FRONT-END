# Classes
1. Introduction to Classes:
   - In programming, classes are used to build objects with specific properties and methods.
   - Classes serve as blueprints that can be used to create multiple objects of the same kind.
   - They provide a way to organize and structure code by grouping related properties and methods together.

2. Syntax and Structure:
   - In JavaScript, classes are defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class starting with a capital letter.
   - Inside the class, you define a constructor function that accepts parameters and assigns them to the object's properties.
   - After the constructor, you can add as many methods as you want, without using the `function` keyword.

3. Instantiating Objects:
   - Once the class is defined, you can create instances of the class, which are individual objects with their own set of properties and methods.
   - To create an instance, you use the `new` keyword followed by the class name and any required parameters.
   - The constructor function is automatically called when an object is instantiated, initializing its properties.

4. Accessing Methods and Properties:
   - Once you have an instance of a class, you can access its methods and properties using dot notation.
   - For example, if you have an instance named `carOne` and it has a method called `turboOn()`, you can invoke it using `carOne.turboOn()`.
   - Methods can also accept parameters, just like regular functions, and you can pass values to them when invoking.

5. Summary:
   - Classes in JavaScript provide a way to create multiple objects with the same structure and behavior.
   - They are defined using the `class` keyword, followed by a constructor function and additional methods.
   - Objects are instantiated using the `new` keyword, and their properties and methods can be accessed using dot notation.
