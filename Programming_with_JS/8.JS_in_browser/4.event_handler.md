# 4. Event Handling

In JavaScript, events are actions that happen on a webpage, like clicking a button or tapping on a picture. We can use JavaScript code to listen for these events and do something when they occur. For example, if we want to add an item to a shopping cart when a user clicks on an "Add to Cart" button, we can write a function that handles the click event and adds the item to the cart.

There are two ways to set up event listeners in JavaScript. One way is to use the `addEventListener` method, where we specify the element we want to listen for events on and the function that will handle the event. Another way is to use HTML event attributes, where we write the function directly in the HTML code and specify the event we want to listen for. Both methods allow us to respond to user actions and make our webpages interactive.

What is an event handler and how does it relate to user-triggered events?How would you use the addEventListener method to listen for a click event on a specific HTML element?Can you explain the difference between using addEventListener and HTML event attributes to set up event listeners?
