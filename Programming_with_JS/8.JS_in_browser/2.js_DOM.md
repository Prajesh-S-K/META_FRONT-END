# 2. JS DOM

Think of the DOM like a TV remote for websites. Just like a remote lets you change the channel or volume on your TV, the DOM lets you change the content on a webpage. But the DOM gives you even more control than a remote. It allows you to change specific parts of a webpage, like an image or a heading, and you can even update them while the page is still open.

The DOM is like a superpower remote for websites because it gives developers the ability to manipulate and update webpages. It's like a JavaScript object that represents the structure of an HTML file. The browser automatically builds the DOM for every webpage it downloads, and as a developer, you can interact with the DOM to make changes to the webpage. You can use the browser's DevTools to interact with the DOM using a graphical user interface, or you can use JavaScript code in the browser's console.
