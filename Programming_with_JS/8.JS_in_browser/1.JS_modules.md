# JS Modules

They are like camera lenses that photographers can swap out depending on the shooting situation. Modules make it easier to organize and manage complex programs by allowing us to add, remove, or replace pieces of code without affecting the rest of the program.

Before modules were introduced, all functions in JavaScript were global, which means they could be accessed from anywhere in the program. This caused problems when different scripts or libraries used the same variable names, leading to conflicts and errors. Modules solve this problem by creating a separate scope for each piece of code, so variables and functions defined in one module don't interfere with those in another.

To use modules in JavaScript, we can use the ES6 module syntax. We can import modules into our code using the `import` keyword and export modules using the `export` keyword. This allows us to easily reuse code and keep our programs organized.
