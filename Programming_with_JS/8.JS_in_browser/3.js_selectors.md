# 3. JS Selectors
Â JavaScript, one of the most powerful features is the ability to manipulate the content of a webpage in real time. This means you can change the color of text, display pop-up messages, and more. To do this, you need to be able to find the specific elements in the webpage that you want to manipulate.

JavaScript provides selectors that allow you to quickly locate these elements. For example, you can use the querySelector method to find elements based on their tag name or class name. If you want to find an element with a specific ID, you can use the getElementById method. These selectors make it easier to find and manipulate elements on a webpage, allowing you to create dynamic and interactive experiences for users.
