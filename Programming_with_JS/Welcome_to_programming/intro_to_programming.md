## Explaination

In this video, we learned about programming and how it plays a role in the modern world. Programming is basically giving instructions to a computer using a programming language. It helps us tell the computer what to do.

Let's imagine a person named Jane who has a to-do list for the day. She needs to buy groceries, track her heart rate while exercising, and buy flowers for her friend. When Jane goes to the grocery store, the cashier uses a barcode reader to get the prices of the products she wants to buy. The cash register then adds up the prices, calculates tax and discounts, and prints out a receipt after Jane pays with her credit card.

Later, Jane uses her smartwatch to track her heart rate while exercising. The smartwatch is connected to a fitness app on her phone, and she can choose what information to share and who can see it. Finally, Jane orders flowers for her friend online, which involves many different computer programs.

All these activities involve computer programs, which are just sets of instructions that tell the computer what to do. Programming is the process of writing these instructions using a programming language like JavaScript. It's like a language that helps us communicate with the computer. These instructions are then saved in the computer's memory and converted into a language that the computer can understand. Programming is an exciting field that is involved in many aspects of our daily lives.
