# Types of Software Testing

1. **End-to-End Testing (E2E Testing)**:
   - **What it is**: This tests the entire application from the user's perspective.
   - **How it works**: It simulates how a user would interact with the application, checking if everything works together as expected.
   - **Example**: Testing a web application by logging in, adding items to a cart, and checking out.

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - **What it is**: This tests how different parts of the application work together.
   - **How it works**: It checks the interactions between various modules or components to ensure they function correctly when combined.
   - **Example**: Testing if a payment processing module works well with the shopping cart module.

3. **Unit Testing**:
   - **What it is**: This tests the smallest parts of the code, usually individual functions or methods.
   - **How it works**: It isolates a piece of code to ensure it behaves as expected.
   - **Example**: Testing a function that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart.

## Testing Pyramid
- **Unit tests** at the base (fast and numerous),
- **Integration tests** in the middle (fewer and moderate speed),
- **End-to-End tests** at the top (the fewest and slowest).
