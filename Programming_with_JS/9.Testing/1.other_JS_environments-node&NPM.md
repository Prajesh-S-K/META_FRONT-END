# Other JavaScript environments - node & NPM

---

## Node.js
- Node.js is a separate environment that allows us to run JavaScript on the server-side or backend of a web application.
- Before Node.js, developers had to use other technologies and languages like PHP or Python for the backend.
- With Node.js, we can now write full-stack JavaScript programs, meaning we can use JavaScript on both the client-side and server-side.
- Node.js can run in multiple settings, such as on the command line, in a desktop application, or on the backend of a web app.

## npm (Node Package Manager)
- npm is a tool that comes with Node.js.
- It allows us to use a large number of libraries and frameworks as Node.js modules.
- These modules are standalone pieces of code that have been published on the npm website.
- We can install these modules using the npm command and then use them in our code to add functionality or solve specific problems.
- The package.json file keeps track of all the modules we have installed and their dependencies.
- Sharing projects with others becomes easier as they can have the same setup by running the `npm install` command.

## Benefits of Node.js and npm
- Node.js allows us to use JavaScript on both the client-side and server-side, enabling full-stack development.
- npm provides access to a vast library of modules, making it easier to add functionality to our projects.
- The package.json file ensures consistent setups across different machines and simplifies project sharing.

- JavaScript was initially used as a front-end language, running in the browser.
- Node.js allows us to use JavaScript on the server-side or backend of a web application.
- Before Node.js, developers had to use other technologies and languages like PHP, Python, C-sharp, Ruby, or Java for the backend.
- With Node.js, we can now write full-stack JavaScript programs, meaning we can use JavaScript on both the client-side and server-side.
- Node.js is a separate environment that can run in multiple settings, such as on the command line, in a desktop application, or on the backend of a web app.
- Node.js uses Google's JavaScript V8 engine to make JavaScript work on the server.
