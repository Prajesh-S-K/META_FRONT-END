# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## What is TDD?
TDD is a software development approach where you write tests for your code before you actually write the code itself.

## How does it work?
The process typically follows these steps:
1. **Write a Test:** Start by writing a test that defines a function or feature you want to implement. This test will initially fail because the function doesn’t exist yet.
2. **Run the Test:** Check to see that the test fails. This confirms that your test is working correctly.
3. **Write the Code:** Now, write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
4. **Run the Test Again:** Check if the test passes. If it does, great! You’ve successfully implemented that feature.
5. **Refactor:** Clean up your code while ensuring that the test still passes. This step helps improve the code quality without changing its functionality.

## Why use TDD?
- It helps catch bugs early.
- Ensures that your code meets the requirements.
- Provides documentation for your code through the tests.

In summary, TDD is like a safety net for developers, ensuring that the code works as intended before moving on to the next feature. It promotes better design and helps maintain high-quality code.
