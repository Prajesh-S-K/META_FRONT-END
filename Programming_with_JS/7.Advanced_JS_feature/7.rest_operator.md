# Rest Operator:
The rest operator is used to group together the remaining items in an array or function parameter into a separate list.

To understand this concept, let's imagine you're planning a trip to Rome and you have a list of seven places you want to visit. However, you realize that you won't have enough time to see all of them. So, you decide to divide your list into two parts: the top three attractions that you must visit and a second list for the remaining attractions.

In JavaScript, you can use the rest operator to easily create these two lists. By using the rest operator, you can extract the first three items from the original list and store them in separate variables. The rest of the items will be grouped together in another variable as a sub-array.

The rest operator is not only useful for organizing lists, but it can also be used in functions. For example, you can use a rest parameter in a function to quickly perform operations on multiple values. The rest parameter allows you to pass in any number of arguments, and they will be treated as an array within the function.
