# Array Methods :
In this reading, the focus is on three specific methods that exist on arrays:

1.  forEach 
2. filter
3.  map

## forEach():
the forEach() method accepts **a function that will work on each array item**. That function's first parameter is the current array item itself, and the second (optional) parameter is the index.

## filter():
It filters your arrays **based on a specific test**. Those array items that pass the test are returned.

## map():
This method is used to map each array item over to another array's item, based on whatever work is performed inside the function that is passed-in to the map as a parameter.


# map methods:
A map can feel very similar to an object in JS.
However, it doesn't have inheritance. No prototypes! This makes it useful as a data storage.
## set():
## get():

# set methods:
A set is a collection of unique values.

# other data types
Some more advanced data structures that have not been covered include:

- Queues
    
- Linked lists (singly-linked and doubly-linked)
    
- Trees
    
- Graphs
