# # De-structuring arrays and objects

Here's a breakdown:

- Objects and arrays: Just like a project folder with files, objects and arrays in JavaScript can have properties that define their characteristics.
- Destructuring syntax: Destructuring allows us to extract specific values from objects or arrays and assign them to new variables using curly brackets {}.
- Making a copy: When we destructure something, we create a new variable that holds a copy of the original value. This copy is completely independent of the original value.
- No connection: The new destructured variable and the original property are not connected in any way. If we change the value of the destructured variable, it won't affect the original property.

For example, let's say we have a math object with a property called "pi". We can destructure the value of "pi" and save it in a new variable called "Pie". If we compare "Pie" and "math.pi", they will have the same value and data type. But if we change the value of "Pie", it won't affect "math.pi".
