# Data Structures 
Here are the main data structures we discussed:
1. Objects: Objects are like containers that hold key-value pairs. We use objects when we want to store and access values using specific keys. For example, we can use an object to store information about a person, with keys like "name" and "age."

2. Arrays: Arrays are ordered lists of values. We use arrays when we want to store multiple values in a specific order. We can access these values using their index number. For example, we can use an array to store a list of grades for a class.
    
3. Maps: Maps are similar to arrays, but they use key-value pairs like objects. The difference is that maps can use any value as a key, while objects can only use strings or symbols as keys.
    
4. Sets: Sets are collections of unique values. We use sets when we want to store a list of values, but we don't want any duplicates. If we try to add a duplicate value to a set, it will simply be ignored.

The choice of which data structure to use depends on the task at hand. Each data structure has its own advantages and is suited for different purposes. By understanding these data structures, we can write more efficient and organized code.

Can you explain the difference between an object and an array in JavaScript?How could you use a map instead of an object to store and access data?What are the advantages of using sets instead of arrays for storing unique values?
