# Template literals

Template literals are a way to work with strings in JavaScript. Before template literals were introduced, we could only create strings using single quotes or double quotes. Template literals allow us to use backticks```(`) as delimiters instead.```

One of the main advantages of template literals is that we can easily include variables in our strings without having to use the + operator or quotes. We can simply put the variable inside ${} within the backticks, and it will be evaluated and inserted into the string. This makes our code cleaner and easier to read.

Another benefit of template literals is that they allow us to create multi-line strings. With regular strings, we would have to use escape characters (\n) to create a new line. But with template literals, we can simply press Enter and start a new line within the backticks.

Overall, template literals provide a more convenient and flexible way to work with strings in JavaScript, making our code more readable and efficient.
