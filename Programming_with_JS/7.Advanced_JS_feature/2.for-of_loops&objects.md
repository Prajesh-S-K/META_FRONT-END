# For- of loops and objects

the difference between two types of loops in JavaScript: the "for-in" loop and the "for-of" loop when applied to objects.

To understand this, let's imagine we have a car object with properties like engine, steering, and speed. The "for-in" loop will iterate over all the properties of the car object, including the properties inherited from its prototype. So, it will loop over not only the properties of the car object but also the properties of its prototype.

On the other hand, the "for-of" loop will only iterate over the properties of the car object itself and will not include any properties from its prototype. This makes the "for-of" loop more reliable when we want to loop over only the properties of the object itself.

In summary, the "for-in" loop iterates over both the object's properties and its prototype's properties, while the "for-of" loop only iterates over the object's properties.

Can you explain why the "for-in" loop is considered unreliable when iterating over object properties?How would you modify the code to only loop over the properties of the car object using a "for-of" loop?What are some advantages of using the "for-of" loop over the "for-in" loop when working with objects in JavaScript?
