# Introduction

Everyday decisions are made based on whether a condition is true or false.

Conditional statements in JavaScript allow developers to run code conditionally based on the evaluation of a condition.

## The if Statement

The if statement checks a condition and executes a code block if the condition is true.

The condition must evaluate to the Boolean value of true for the code block to be executed.

Comparison operators like equal to, greater than, less than, and not equal to can be used to evaluate the condition.

## The if-else Statement

The if-else statement handles both outcomes of a conditional request.

If a condition is true, a code block is executed. If it's false, a different code block is executed.

It is useful for scenarios where there are two possible outcomes.

## The else-if Statement

The else-if statement allows testing multiple conditions.

It is used when there are more than two possible outcomes.

Additional code blocks can be added to handle different conditions.

## Conclusion

Conditional statements are a powerful tool in JavaScript programming.
They allow developers to control the flow of code based on specific conditions.
