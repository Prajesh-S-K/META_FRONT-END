# Looping Construct

A looping construct is a programming concept that allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met. It is used to perform repetitive tasks efficiently and reduce the amount of code needed.

## Syntax

There are different types of looping constructs in JavaScript, including the for loop and the while loop. Here is the syntax for each:

### For Loop

```js
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

The initialization statement is executed before the loop starts and is used to initialize the loop counter.

The condition is evaluated before each iteration. If it is true, the loop continues; if it is false, the loop stops.

The increment/decrement statement is executed after each iteration and is used to update the loop counter.

### While Loop
```js
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
    // increment/decrement statement
}
```
The condition is evaluated before each iteration. If it is true, the loop continues; if it is false, the loop stops.

The code inside the loop is executed as long as the condition is true.

The increment/decrement statement is used to update the loop counter.

## Benefits of Looping Constructs

- Allows you to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
- Reduces the amount of code needed.
- Provides a way to control the number of iterations based on a condition.
- Helps avoid code duplication.
