# Conditional Statements in JavaScript

## Introduction

- Conditional statements are used to run pieces of code based on whether a condition is true or false.
- They allow you to control the flow of your program and make decisions based on certain conditions.

## The Building Blocks of a Program

- Conditional statements are an essential building block of any program.
- They help you create logic and make your program more dynamic and responsive.

## Programming Paradigms

- Conditional statements are a fundamental concept in programming and are used in various programming paradigms.
- They are commonly used in imperative programming, object-oriented programming, and functional programming.

## Testing

- Conditional statements are often used in testing scenarios to check if certain conditions are met before executing specific code.
- They help ensure that your program behaves as expected and handles different scenarios correctly.

## End-of-Course Graded Assessment

- Conditional statements are likely to be covered in the end-of-course graded assessment.
- Make sure to understand how to use conditional statements effectively to solve programming problems.
