# Math Object

The Math object is a built-in object in JavaScript that provides mathematical functions and constants. It allows you to perform various mathematical operations in your code.

## Random Method

- The random method of the Math object generates a random decimal number between 0 and 0.99.
- You can save the result of the random method in a variable and use it in your code.
- To generate a random number larger than one, you can multiply the variable by 10.

## Ceil Method

- The ceil method of the Math object is used to round up any decimal number to the nearest integer.
- It can only round upwards, so if you pass a decimal number to the ceil method, it will always return the next higher integer.

## Combining Random and Ceil Methods

- You can combine the random and ceil methods to generate a random integer between a specific range.
- Multiply the result of the random method by the desired range and pass it through the ceil method to get a random integer within that range.
