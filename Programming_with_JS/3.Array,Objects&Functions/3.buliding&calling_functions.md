# Topic: Building and Calling Functions

## What is a Function?
- A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
- It allows you to organize your code into smaller, manageable pieces.

## Function Declaration
- To create a function, you need to declare it using the `function` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses.
- You can also specify parameters inside the parentheses if the function needs to accept inputs.

## Function Invocation
- Once a function is declared, you can invoke or call it to execute the code inside the function.
- To call a function, you simply write the function name followed by parentheses.

## Example of Building and Calling a Function
```javascript
// Function Declaration
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

// Function Invocation
greet("John");
```

## Benefits of Using Functions

- Functions help in code reusability, as you can use the same function multiple times in your code.
- They make your code more organized and easier to read and understand.
- Functions also allow you to modularize your code, making it easier to maintain and update.

## Additional Function Concepts

- Functions can have return statements to return a value back to the caller.
- You can also define default parameter values for functions.
- Arrow functions are a more concise way to declare functions in JavaScript.
