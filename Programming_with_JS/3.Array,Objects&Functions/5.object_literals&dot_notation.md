# Object Literals and the Dot Notation

- Object literal syntax is a common way of building an object in JavaScript.
- It involves using curly braces {} to define an object.
- The object literal is often assigned to a variable for easy access and manipulation.
- Properties and their values are specified as key-value pairs within the object literal.
- The dot notation is used to access and update properties of an object.
- To create an object using object literal syntax:
var user = {}; // create an empty object
- To assign values to object properties using the dot notation:
```js
user.name = "John"; // add a "name" property with the value "John"
```
- To access object properties using the dot notation:
```js
console.log(user.name); // output: "John"
```
