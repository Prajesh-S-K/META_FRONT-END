# Functions in JavaScript

## Introduction to Functions
- Functions allow you to group related actions and avoid repetition in your code.
- They are like a set of stored instructions that can be called or invoked whenever needed.

## Structure of a Function
- A function is declared using the keyword `function` followed by the function name and parentheses.
- The code to be executed is placed inside curly braces, known as the body of the function.

## Calling a Function
- To run the code inside a function, you need to call or invoke the function by typing its name followed by parentheses.

## Advantages of Functions
- Functions help in writing more efficient and reusable code.
- They allow you to pass values, known as arguments, to perform different operations.
- Function parameters act like variable names that can be assigned different values when the function is called.

## Summary
- Functions in JavaScript are a way to group related actions and avoid repetition in your code.
- They have a structure with a function name, parentheses, and a body of code.
