# A Closer Look at Strings

Strings are a data type in JavaScript used to represent text.
They are enclosed in single quotes (''), double quotes ("") or backticks ().
Strings can be manipulated and accessed using various methods and properties.

## Array Characteristics of Strings

- In JavaScript, strings behave like arrays in some ways.
- You can iterate over a string using a for loop or a for...of loop.
- The length property can be used to get the number of characters in a string.

## String Manipulation

- Strings can be concatenated using the concatenation operator (+) or the concat() method.
- The plus operator acts as a concatenation operator, joining strings together.
- The concat() method can be used to add values to a string.

## Differences Between Strings and Arrays

- Despite their similar behavior, strings are not arrays.
Array methods cannot be directly used on strings.
- Trying to use array methods on strings will result in an error.
