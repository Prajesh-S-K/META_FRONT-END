## Topic: Introduction to Programming

Programming is the process of creating instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks. It involves writing code using programming languages. Here's an example of a simple program written in Python:

```python
# This program prints "Hello, World!" to the console
print("Hello, World!")
```


# This program calculates the sum of two numbers
```
num1 = 5
num2 = 10
sum = num1 + num2
print("The sum is:", sum)
```

## Number

In JavaScript, numbers are a foundational data type that represent both integer and decimal point numbers.
Numbers can be used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulus.

Mathematical operators in JavaScript include plus (+) for addition, minus (-) for subtraction, asterisk (*) for multiplication, forward-slash (/) for division, double star (**) for exponentiation, and modulus (%) for finding the remainder.

Parentheses can be used to group more complex calculations and control the order of operations.

JavaScript follows the standard mathematical sequence of calculation, where multiplication and division take precedence over addition and subtraction. However, the order can be overridden using parentheses.

Here is an example of using parentheses in JavaScript with numbers and mathematical operators:

``` javascript
// Addition
2 + 2 // returns 4

// Subtraction
4 - 2 // returns 2

// Multiplication
4 * 4 // returns 16

// Division
16 / 4 // returns 4

// Exponentiation
10 ** 2 // returns 100

// Modulus
9 % 8 // returns 1
16 % 8 // returns 0

// Using parentheses
2 * (4 + 8) // returns 24
```

These are the basic concepts related to numbers in JavaScript. If you would like to learn more about mathematical operators, you can refer to the additional reading provided in the course material.

## Strings :

What is a string?
A string in JavaScript is a collection of characters enclosed by single quotes, double quotes. Such a collection of characters is known as a string datatype. Strings are one of the most common types of data you'll be working with.

To code a string, I type in a pair of single quotation marks. This piece of code with just an opening and closing single quote is referred to as an empty string. To build an empty string, I can also use double quotation marks.

While empty strings have their place in JavaScript, they're not very versatile. But strings don't have to be empty, so let me build a non-empty string with some letters and an exclamation mark. I do this by typing the words hello there, and an exclamation mark within a pair of single quotation marks.

Besides letters and punctuation symbols, we can add almost any other character into a string, including numbers. For example, I can type 'hello there! ' and follow it up with several symbols and numbers. This is still a valid string.

There's one thing that strings can't do and that is break onto the next line. When I type a single quotation mark, the word hello, and then press Enter before typing the second quotation mark, it results in an error which stops the code from running. The same happens if I use double quotation marks.

When you use single or double quotes to surround string values, these characters are referred to as delimiters. This is because I use them to delimit a given string value from the rest of my code.

There are some unusual situations that can trip you up when you first start using strings in JavaScript. For example, let's say that I want to create a new string. I do this by typing a single quotation mark, followed by the phrase, it is a lovely day, and I close the string with a second single quotation mark. Now I want to use the contraction of it is by using an apostrophe but again, error code. This is because JavaScript reads the word it, that is the first two letters as forming a string, and then it doesn't understand the rest of the code because of the apostrophe. To fix this issue, I need to nest single quotes inside double quotes. I do this by replacing the original single quotation marks on either side of the phrase with double quotation marks, and now you'll notice there are no more errors.

You can make single and double quotes too but it's better to stick with one or the other because it can be confusing and lacks consistency.

## Boolean :

- The Boolean data type is used to check if a statement is true or false in JavaScript.
- It is a foundational part of knowing how to use JavaScript.
- The Boolean data type has two possible values: true and false.
- Comparisons using operators like less than (<), greater than (>), equality (==), strict equality (===), inequality (!=), and strict inequality (!==) return Boolean values.
- The double equals sign (==) checks for value equality, while the triple equals sign (===) checks for both value and type equality.
- The exclamation mark with an equal sign (!=) checks for inequality, while the exclamation mark with two equal signs (!==) checks for both inequality of value and type.
- The Boolean data type is not limited to comparing numbers; it can also be used to compare strings and other data types.
- Understanding the Boolean data type is essential for writing conditional statements and making logical decisions in JavaScript.
