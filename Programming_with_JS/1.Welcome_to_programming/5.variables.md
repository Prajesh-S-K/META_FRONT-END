# Variables in JavaScript:

In JavaScript, variables are like containers that hold information. They allow us to store and reuse values in our code. Think of a variable as a box with a label on it. We can put different things in the box and use the label to refer to what's inside.

Here's a breakdown:

- Declaring a variable: When we declare a variable, we're telling JavaScript that we want to create a new box to store a value. We use the keyword `var` followed by the name we want to give to the variable. For example, `var person;` creates a variable called `person`.

- Assigning a value: After declaring a variable, we can assign a value to it. This means putting something inside the box. We use the assignment operator `=` to do this. For example, `person = 'John';` assigns the value `'John'` to the variable `person`.

- Using the variable: Once we have a value stored in a variable, we can use it in our code. We can combine the value with other text or perform operations on it. For example, we can use the variable `person` to output the text "Hello John" by using the `console.log` method like this: `console.log('Hello ' + person);`.

Variables are useful because they allow us to reuse values and make our code more flexible. We can change the value of a variable at any time, and the code that uses the variable will automatically use the new value. This makes our programs versatile and adaptable.
