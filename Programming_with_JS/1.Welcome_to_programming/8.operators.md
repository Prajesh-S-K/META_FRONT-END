# Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values in programming. They manipulate individual data items and return a result. There are different types of operators that serve different purposes.

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable. They can also be used for simple and complex calculations. Some common assignment operators include:

- Addition operator: +
- Subtraction operator: -
- Division operator: /
- Multiplication operator: *

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare two values and return a logical value based on whether the comparison is true or false. They are used to check if values are greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to each other. Some common comparison operators include:

- Greater than: >
- Less than: <
- Equal to: ==
- Not equal to: !=

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to determine if a condition is true or false. They are often used to combine multiple conditions. Some common logical operators include:

- AND operator: &&
- OR operator: ||
- NOT operator: !

These operators are used to control the flow of a program based on certain criteria.
